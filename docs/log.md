## Author Declarations & Notes

### MASTCHEN Declaration (声明.txt)

The creator's original intent was to create a "100% Chinese character." While the character's appearance references BLAZE from *Streets of Rage*, A-Shi is designed as a fully Chinese character. The resemblance to BLAZE is explained in-universe: she admired that character when playing games as a child.

- Voice acting is Chinese only
- Special thanks to Miss Donggong (冬弓) for providing A-Shi's voice
- The creator hoped Xuanyuan Shi would become a character that domestic MUGEN could be proud of

**Clarifications regarding other releases:**
- The "Xuanyuan Shi" released in District 11 (Japan) is NOT the original character—it is a cosplay version featuring two sisters ("Shi" and "Zi")
- The challenger Xuanyuan Shi in Fkof is a clone with only partial abilities

### Author Statement (关于轩辕诗的申明.txt)

- Completion of voice source files with assistance from Miss Donggong
- Official background setting by: 吉黑阵 (Jihieizhen) & 琴 (Qin)
- Official voice: 冬弓 (Donggong)
